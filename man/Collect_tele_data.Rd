\title{Calculate Residency Metrics from Telemetry Data}
\usage{
Collect_tele_data(animalxy.all, study_design, grouping = "Speed")
}
\arguments{
\item{animalxy.all}{A data frame of animal trajectories (output from \code{\link{ABM_sim}}).}

\item{study_design}{A list containing simulation parameters. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{t_steps}: Total time steps.
\item \code{dt}: Time interval.
}}

\item{grouping}{A character string indicating the column name to group by
(default is "Speed"). The function assumes this column exists in the data
(or that \code{lscape_type} can be renamed to it).}
}
\value{
A data frame (tibble) sorted by the grouping variable in descending order, containing:
\itemize{
\item The grouping column (e.g., \code{Speed}).
\item \code{n}: The count of location fixes in that category.
\item \code{stay_prop}: The proportion of total fixes found in that category.
\item \code{stay_sd}: The standard deviation of the log-transformed proportion.
}
}
\description{
Aggregates animal trajectory data to calculate the proportion of time animals
spend in different landscape categories (or other grouping variables). It computes
the raw counts, proportions (\code{stay_prop}), and the standard deviation associated
with the log-transformed proportions.
}
\details{
The function subsets the data based on the simulation time steps defined in
\code{study_design}. It specifically calculates the standard deviation for the
log-transformed counts using the Delta method approximation:
\code{sqrt(p*(1-p)/n) / p}.
