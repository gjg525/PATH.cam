\title{Generate a Randomized Landscape of Movement Speeds}
\usage{
lscape_creator(study_design, lscape_design)
}
\arguments{
\item{study_design}{A list containing simulation parameters. Must include:
\itemize{
\item \code{q}: Total number of grid cells (integer). The function assumes a
square grid, so \code{sqrt(q)} should ideally be an integer.
}}

\item{lscape_design}{A list (or data frame) defining the speed categories. Must include vectors for:
\itemize{
\item \code{Speed_ID}: Names of the speed categories (e.g., "Fast", "Slow").
\item \code{Speed_mins}: Minimum speed values for each category.
\item \code{Speed_maxes}: Maximum speed values for each category.
}}
}
\value{
A tibble representing the landscape grid with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{Index}: Cell ID.
\item \code{X}, \code{Y}: Grid coordinates.
\item \code{Speed}: Assigned speed category.
\item \code{Min}, \code{Max}: Bounds for the assigned category.
\item \code{Value}: The specific randomized speed value for that cell.
}
}
\description{
Creates a spatial grid representing the landscape and assigns random movement
speed categories to each grid cell.
}
\details{
The function generates a square grid based on the total number of cells (\code{q})
defined in \code{study_design}. It then randomly samples (with replacement) from
the speed categories defined in \code{lscape_design} to assign a landscape type
(e.g., "Forest", "Open") to each cell. Finally, it draws a specific continuous
speed value for each cell from a uniform distribution bounded by that category's
min/max limits.
